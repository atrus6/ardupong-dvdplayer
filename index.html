  <h1>Pong on a DVD player</h1>
  <p>A while ago, I had a spare Arduino laying around, along with a portable DVD player,
  and so I decided to merge them together, and create a Pong machine using the two.

  Sadly, this project was several years ago, and both the DVD player and the video of the
  completed project have been lost through 3 moves. I do however have my build pictures,
  and the source, so I can at least share that. You can click on any of the images for
  a full sized version.</p>

  <p>So, as we can see, it's a pretty standard DVD player. Widescreen 480p. What
  made this project easier was the fact that it had a composite input. Since
  an Arduino can output a composite signal pretty easily, that combined with Pong
  was a perfect little project to attempt.</p>

  <a href='img/opened.jpg'><img src='img/opened_thumb.jpg' alt='Opened Up.'></a>

  <p>Essentially I'd be making my own Nintendo DS, just bigger, heavier and with
  only one game. The control would be the stop/pause/ff/rw buttons, with the
  play button starting and restarting the game.

  The pause and stop buttons would move your paddle up and down. The ff/rw buttons
  would increase and decrease the difficulty of the AI that you would be playing
  against.</p>

  <p>A quick initial setup to make sure that it all worked, before I started tearing
  it all up. Using a sacrificial cable, I could plug the Arduino into the DVD
  player and it would play Pong. I used this time to made the right side AI
  controlled. Before starting a round, you could increase the difficulty of the
  AI. Instead of trying to be fancy, I simply allowed the AI to move faster.
  It's remarkably simple getting a composite signal out.</p>

  <a href='img/opened_up.jpg'><img src='img/opened_up_thumb.jpg' alt='The DVD player opened up.'></a>

  <p>And here it is opened up. One of the goals was to make it look 'whole' again,
  so the DVD reading mechanism would be removed, and the Arduino would be put back in
  its place.</p>

  <a href='img/opened_no_dvd.jpg'><img src='img/opened_no_dvd_thumb.jpg' alt='The opened DVD player with no DVD carriage.'></a>

  <p>And there is plenty of room without the dvd carriage in there.</p>

  <a href="img/video_hijack.jpg"><img src='img/video_hijack_thumb.jpg' alt='Soldered wires hijacking the composite input.'></a>

  <p>The first major step was allowing the Arduino to output on the composite lines
  without actually plugging into the jack. So I soldered some wires on the pads.
  The pads were determined through trial and error.</p>

  <a href='img/ground_cheat.jpg'><img src='img/ground_cheat_thumb.jpg' alt='An ugly hack stabilizing video input.'></a>

  <p>However, it wasn't a very stable image. It would flicker from the DVD menu, to
  the composite output. For some reason tying these three pads together made it
  stable. This was discovered by accident while measuring continuities between
  pads and noticing how it flip flopped less when certain pads were being checked.
  It's ugly as hell, but that's what covers are for, no?</p>

  <a href="img/power_lines.jpg"><img src='img/power_lines_thumb.jpg' alt='Attaching power lines for the Arduino.'></a>

  <p>Since I wanted this to be completely self-contained, I needed a way to power
  the Arduino, without extra wires. Luckily for me, the input power for the DVD
  player was at a safe range for the Arduino, so I could simply tap straight into
  it.</p>

  <a href='img/pretty_wires.jpg'><img src='img/pretty_wires_thumb.jpg' alt='Looking better with the main board in place.'></a>

  <p>And look how nice that solder job looks after the main board is put back! There
  are no problems if you can't see them /s. Again, it's kinda cool that two wires
  are needed for video output. There are more wires for the controls!</p>

  <a href="img/buttons_front.jpg"><img src='img/buttons_front_thumb.jpg' alt='The front view of the button board.'></a>
  <a href="img/buttons_back.jpg"><img src='img/buttons_back_thumb.jpg' alt='The back view of the button board.'></a>

  <p>This was a pretty simple board to decipher. Thankfully I didn't need to do any
  more 'ground cheats' with this one.</p>

  <a href='img/button_wires.jpg'><img src='img/button_wires_thumb.jpg' alt='All the wires soldered up on the button board.'></a>

  <p>Here I soldered some extensions to the wires. I kept track of which wire went
  where simply by the order, as it was a ribbon cable. I really wish that I had
  taken a picture of it all connected before I closed the case, but I forgot to
  take pictures as I neared the end of the project.</p>

  <p>And here we see it running. This was a pretty neat weekend project, it certainly
  put a smile on my face.</p>
